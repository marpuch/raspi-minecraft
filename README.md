Building castles (and other stuff) in Minecraft using Python

Step by step what needs to be done here:

1. Go to: https://gist.github.com/noahcoad/fc9d3984a5d4d61648269c0a9477c622. Do what's required.
2. Check out this repository. Run the python scripts.

NOTE: for my own convenience I have integrated the mcpi code already.
